Description: Consider a possibly nonlinear nonparametric regression
   with p regressors. We provide evaluations by 13 methods to rank
   regressors by their practical significance or importance using 
   various methods, including machine learning tools. Comprehensive
   methods are as follows. 
   m6=Generalized partial correlation coefficient or
   GPCC by Vinod (2021)<doi:10.1007/s10614-021-10190-x> and
   Vinod (2022)<https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/15/1/32>.
   m7= a generalization of psychologists' effect size incorporating 
   nonlinearity and many variables.
   m8= local linear partial (dy/dxi) using the 'np' package for kernel 
   regressions.
   m9= partial (dy/dxi) using the 'NNS' package.
   m10= importance measure using the 'NNS' boost function.
   m11= Shapley Value measure of importance (cooperative game theory).
   m12 and m13= two versions of the random forest algorithm.
